## Big-O notation O()

Big-O notation represents the upper limit of an algorithm's cost and is associated with a big O parentheses `O(n)` in a formula that uses `n` as the size of the input.

When we're using the Big-O notation, what we're doing is classifying how a function behaves as the size of the input grows or as `n` gets larger.
