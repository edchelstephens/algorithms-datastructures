# Measuring Sorting Algorithm Performance

## 1. Comparison

- When two values in the array being sorted are compared for relative equality

## 2. Swaps

- When two values in the array being sorted exchange places

# Algorithms:

## Bubble sort

- Iterate
  visit each item in the array from the start to the end

- Swap
  If two neighboring items are out of order, swap them

- Repeat
  Repeat this process until the array is sorted

## Insertion sort

- Iterate
  Visit each item in the array from the start to the end

- Compare
  Find out of order neighboring items

- Shift and Insert
  Find the insertion point, shift and insert
